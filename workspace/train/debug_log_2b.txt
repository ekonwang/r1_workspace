<process>
- To determine the total number of objects, we count each distinct object present in the image.
- Start with the prominent yellow objects, which are the large yellow sphere (yellow), yellow cylinder, and a small golden ball. To avoid counting them again, we also add the small cylinder and all the small yellow objects (small yellow object). 
- Continue with the red, purple, and gray objects, counting all the other objects mentioned.
- Each cylinder is counted among the objects, regardless of its size.

Final thought: After examining each object, we observe they include large and small shapes, metallic and non-metallic colors, and varying sizes. Thus, the count is 10.

To determine the number of objects in the image, let's count each distinct object step-by-step:
- The large shiny cube is only visible in one view.
- The large blue metallic object is only visible in one view.
- The large green metallic cylinder is only visible in one view.
- The large gray rubber sphere in front center.
- The smaller gray rubber sphere behind the large gray rubber sphere.
- The large gray rubber sphere in the right background.
- The large blue matte cube in the bottom left.
- The large gray rubber sphere back center.
- The large yellow rubber sphere in the bottom left.
- The large brown rubber sphere in the bottom left.
- The large glossy brown metal sphere in the bottom left.
- The large brown rubber cylinder in the bottom left.

So, there are 13 objects in the image: the brown matte object at the bottom left, the large metal cube, the gray rubber balls, the green metal cylinder, the large metallic block, the large gray rubber sphere, the large gray rubber sphere, the smaller gray rubber ball, the large yellow rubber sphere, the large green rubber cylinder, the large shiny gray rubber cylinder, the large blue rubber matte object, and the large brown metallic object.

We need to count the number of objects in the image, including both cubes and spheres. Let's start with individual cubes and spheres one by one.

1. Cube- There are three big cubes and two smaller gray cubes, making it a total of 5 cubes.
2. Cuboid- There are four different sized cubes, two big brown and one small brown cube, as well as a smaller gray cube.
3. Sphere- There are two small spheres and one big green sphere, totaling 3 spheres.

Now let's summarize the total number of objects:
There are 5 cubes and 3 spheres.
